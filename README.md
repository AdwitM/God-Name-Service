# God Name Service ðŸ˜‡
A project inspired from ENS (Ethereum Name Service) on Polygon Mumbai Testnet.  
  
On GNS, Users can mint a domain with the name `.god` and it will be minted as an NFT which can point to anything on the internet.    
Name services are like global APIs. Everyone can access them and you can store data that can be queried.  

GNS is written in Solidity and the smart contract was deployed using hardhat and POKT. The frontend has been done in reactjs and deployed on vercel. 

Get your .god domain today and pay no gas because this project is on a Testnet :P
